This is an end to end deployment project which i have done w.r.t diabetes prediction with the help of internet resources for my front end for better vizualization 
, the project is simple where in i am using random forest classifier for implementation and creating a flask api and then deploying it on heroku (Paas)
note:
the data set contains values as 0 which has to be replaced by nan since they make no sense to the input and then we do feature engineering over it .
